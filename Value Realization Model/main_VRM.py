"""
Utility Python program to generate a Value Realization Model.
It uses a simple model to predict the probability of a high value or a
low value for a stock given the sequence of buys(asks being lifted) or sells(bids being hit).
The script will prompt the user to enter a sequence of buy(s)/sell(s) with trade prices like `bbssbs` or `BSBSBB`.
Buy/sell sequences can also be entered through a text file containing these sequences as
the first command line argument to the script_name.
